# Installing the Python extension

This extends the default dev toolkit to install and enable the Python VSCode extension.

It reuses the default dev toolkit Dockerfile.

You can use this example as a base to understand how to install VScode extensions in the dev-toolkit.

See the `devcontainer.json` file for more details.
